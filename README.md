# Cat-Dog Talk Back
By Keturah Howard and Sommer Howe.

## Description
This is super similar to my talkback application. Only... you can't delete the barking or meowing. Just makes it more realistic! Sometimes the most chaotic things in life are just out of our grasp of control, you know? The code in this web application was made with the intention to practice .preppend() .before() in jQuery for adding elements into the DOM through jQuery methods.  

## Set Up Options

1. Open it's gh-pages [here](https://keturahdev.github.io/calculator2/)
2. Or, clone, and then in terminal cd into the project and type 'open index.html', or to look at the code type 'code .'.

## Technologies Used
* Bootstrap version 3.3.7
* jQuery
* Javascript
* CSS
* Visual Studio Code
